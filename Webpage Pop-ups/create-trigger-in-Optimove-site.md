### How to create a trigger based on your tracked custom events in order to execute a realtime campaign:

 1. In your Optimove site, go to Manage Triggers section
 2. If you don’t already have a category, create one by clicking on “New Category”
 3. Within your chosen category, add a “New Trigger”

 4. Click on “Add Event” and pick from the drop down menu the desired custom event to trigger from, including relevant values
>**Notes:**
>  - Events will only be shown if Product Integration Team configured them for you. If you do not see an event that was already configured, please contact the Product Integration Team.
>  - The parameter’s values are case sensitive, so they must match exactly as they are being sent to the Optimove SDK
>  - If you do not add/choose a value for a specific parameter, it will automatically check for “any” values
>  	
5.	Review your trigger and click on “Save”
